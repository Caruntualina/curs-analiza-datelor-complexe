I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face

(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Oh, oh

Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease
Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after happily
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
Oh, and since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I'll keep on trying
Might as well
If you decide
All is well
I'll keep on trying
Might as well
If you decide
All is well (all is well)
Though I am bruised
Face of contusions
Know I'll keep moving
Though I am bruised
Face of contusions
Know I'll keep moving
Know I'll keep moving
Rust around the rim
Drink it anyway
I cut my lip
Isn't what I want
Blood is on my tongue
I cut my lip
I keep on going back
Even though it's me I abuse
I'll keep on going back
Even
Though I am bruised
Face of contusions
Know I'll keep moving
Though I am bruised
Face of contusions
Know I'll keep moving

Rust around the rim

Oh, oh, yeah

Oh, oh, yeah
I don't mind at all
Lean on my pride

So where are you? It's been a little while
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue
Dependant at times
Poisonous vibration
Help my body run
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety
Don't know what's inside of me
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no, no
Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that I've got, no
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no, no
Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
I want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no

I know
Where you stand
Silent
In the trees
And that's
Where I am
Silent
In the trees
Why won't you speak?
Where I happen to be
Silent
In the trees
Standing cowardly
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say
Hello

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
Yeah, trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think, "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it)
(Watch it)
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us
You know
I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know
I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
You know
I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
I would get beat to
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
On the record for you
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her if
I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go
Write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know
They think it's messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype (don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
I-I-I I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
Yeah yeah yeah
I am not as fine as I seem
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that hold's back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far, kid
Made it this far
Made it this far
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
In city, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered
It's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through
Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing someone
Folina
Sahlo Folina
Sahlo
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
(Sahlo) I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low (low, low)
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban, I'm a bandito
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing

They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They be alive tomorrow?
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists
And no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire my time today
I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel
I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
It is faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think
I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire my time today
I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit (cover me)
Dusting off my jumpsuit, cover me
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone, I'll stop my plans
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (if you need anyone)
If you need anyone (if you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I'm taking over my body
Back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
"T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot
Like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door?
I must'a forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's rolling still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it
To a tree tell it, you belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
And I'll be holding on to you
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
Ah ah ah (and I'll be holding on to you)
And I'll be holding on to you
And I'll be holding on to you
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how
She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart
I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I've ever been
The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how
She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart
I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how
She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart
I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart
She's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart
She's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I've ever been
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I plead my case
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me
Na na na na oh
Na na na na oh
Na na na na oh
Three lights are lit
But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking, 'Wow
I probably should've stayed inside my house'
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I plead my case
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's high for good reason
So please
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's high for good reason
So please
Na na na na oh, oh
Na na na na oh, oh
Na na na na oh, oh
Na na na na oh, oh
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I'm tired
Of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing
Embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
The burning
Is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know
They know
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know
Last year
I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year
Though I'm far from home
In TRENCH I'm not alone
These faces facing me
They know
They know
What I mean
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
Though I'm weak
Beaten down
I'll slip away
Into the sound
The ghost of you
Is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath
I've got two faces
Blurry's the one I'm not
I've got two faces
Blurry's the one I'm not
I need your help to
Take him out
I need your help to
Take him out
Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away
Into the sound
The ghost of you
Is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath
Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away
Into the sound
The ghost of you
Is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be!
Don't let me be!
Ah
Yeah
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swearing to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know oh ow, what that means, I know oh oh oh ow
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans,
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands yeah
Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat
But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands yeah
We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands
